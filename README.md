# Discord Media Tool

Want to upload videos and clips directly onto Discord? Frustrated with their file size limits? Stingy like me and don't want to pay for Nitro?
Here's a solution for you!

Discord Media Tool is a program that compresses your video and audio files to be under a specified size while maximizing quality so you can easily upload files that will be embedded in Discord chats. The design is intended to be very simple such that you can just run the program, select a file, and compress it.

Your files remain as your business! All operations are done locally on your machine so you don't have to upload your files onto some website.

## Interface

The interface is straightforward. For most people wanting to compress videos, just select a video file and click compress. 
Don't understand an option? No problem? Just hover your cursor over the option and a tool tip should appear.

## How to use:
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Gordon-T/Discord-Media-Tool/releases) and download the `latest.zip`
2. Go to [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and download a windows build of FFmpeg
3. Extract the `latest.zip` file and the ffmpeg build files
5. Take the `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` from the `/bin` folder of the extracted ffmpeg build and place them in the same directory as `DMT.exe` from the extracted `latest.zip`
  
   The resulting file structure should look like:
    ```
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄüìÅDMT Folder
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂Ô∏èDMT.exe
    ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄüìÑffmpeg.exe
    ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄüìÑffprobe.exe
    ```
6. Run `DMT.exe`
7. Click "Select..." for either the "Video Converter" or "MP3 Converter" and choose a file using the file explorer prompt
8. Click "Compress"
9. The newly encoded file should be in the same directory as the selected file with `_<video codec>` appended to the file name

## Technical decisions
### Video Converter
For the video converter you can choose the H264 or VP9 codecs:
 - **H264:** is the default as it has the widest viewing compatibility while maintaining a balance of decent video quality and encoding speed.
 - **VP9:** allows for better video quality over H264 in most cases but doesn't play natively in Discord for iOS devices and takes much longer to encode.

The audio for encoded videos uses the Opus audio codec at 96 kb/s which is good enough where most people can't hear any noticable difference, especially for clips.

With the default options, video files compressed by Discord Media Tool should allow people without Discord Nitro to upload embedded video clips without sacrificing too much of the video quality assuming you aren't trying to cram a feature-length film in 10 megabytes. Be reasonable with the length of the video files you want to compress since longer video files = lower video quality. If you aren't satisfied with the H264 compressed results, try the VP9 codec which can improve quality. If you still are not satisfied with the video quality, you might need to just upload the video file elsewhere or consider cutting down the length of your video.

### Audio Converter
For the audio converter you can choose between MP3 or Opus codecs:
 - **MP3** is the default as it is ubiquitous, easily recognized as audio, and will play on pretty much anything that has a speaker.
 - **Opus** is a newer and more advanced codec compared to MP3 that can achieve higher perceived quality at the same or even less bitrate.

This is primarily intended to compress down sound bite or a few minute long audio files. If the resulting file is too large, try lowering the bitrate as encoding a audio file is very quick compared to video encoding.

## Building
1. Have or install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= 1.23.5
2. Clone and extract this repository
3. Run `go build -ldflags="-H=windowsgui -s -w" -o .` in the extracted directory
4. `DMT.exe` should be built in the same directory
